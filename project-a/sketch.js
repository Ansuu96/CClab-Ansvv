                <p>horanghae immunoid</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Biomedical lab that was studying mutation cells, year 2100</p>

</h3>
                <p>In the year 2100, the air was filled with a lethal electronic mist that paralyzes the natural T-cells that humans have, 
                    This forced researchers to develop creatures that works better than the current immune system. When they finally, perfected their creature the researchers 
                    injected themselves.
                    Through a microscopic camera lens, the team watches as this creature navigates the crimson tunnels of their own veins to clear the clotted blood cells.
                     When the user moves the mouse, the creature glides gracefully to nudge these cells back into motion. 
                     The moment a mutated virus appears, a click of the mouse causes the creature’s body to become rigid and its eyes to enlargen.

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>When injected into your body it lives within your bloodstream.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>It's a microscopic, alien like shaped guardian that's inserted within the human bloodstream, It moves in a vibrating way that outpaces any natural cells. It uses advanced sensors and can detect and intercept foreign pathogens like viruses with accuracy before they even trigger a systemic immune response. 
                    When it encounters a blockage or slowing red blood
                     cells during a cardiac attack, it uses it's body to "nudge" that red blood cell to restart blood flow/circulation. 
                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The creature is typically nice and glides smoothly to nudge red blood cells, However its demeanor shifts instantly when they detect a pathogen(virus).
                         The moment a virus is sensed, the creature’s body becomes rigid and its eyes expand becoming focused entirely on the threat.

                The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living
                terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as
                one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing
                them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as
                well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil
                record. (This is from Wikipedia, write the story, history, facts, tales, myths, anecdotes about your
                creature.)

                <span class="yellow">User Manual</span>  
                         <p> 1. As you move your cursor across the screen, the creature moves with the cursor. 
                         You can manually steer it toward areas of red blood cells to nudge them.
                        2. The moment you click, the creature’s behavior becomes alerted; its body goes rigid, and its eyes expand. 
                        In this state, it ignores the general flow of the blood to focus entirely on the virus.
